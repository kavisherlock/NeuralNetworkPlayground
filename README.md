Various ways to implement Neural Networks (and other machine learning techniques)
All are trainied, evaluated and tested using the MNIST digit recognition dataset

Currenty impletmented:
* A Logistic Regression class as my introduction to Theano. Trained and tested on the MNIST data.
* A simple Neural Network class: a neural network from scratch based in Michael Neilson's book Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* A simple Neural Network class using Theano. Current best accuracy on MNIST: 97.01% using a [784, 100, 75, 10] network, 10 epochs, 0.05 learning rate and mini batch size of 10
